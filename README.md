### Employee Attrition Rate Prediction Using ZenML and Streamlit

#### Introduction
Employee attrition is a critical issue for businesses, particularly for those with large workforces. High turnover rates lead to increased hiring and training costs, reduced productivity, and a loss of valuable knowledge and experience. Predicting employee attrition can provide organizations with insights into which employees are at risk of leaving, allowing for proactive intervention strategies to retain talent.

In this case study, we present an **Employee Attrition Rate Prediction** system built using **ZenML**, an MLOps orchestration tool, and **Streamlit**, an open-source Python framework for creating interactive web applications. This system not only predicts the likelihood of an employee leaving but also automates the model management process, ensuring that the most accurate models are continuously deployed for real-time predictions.

#### Dataset
The project utilized the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance** dataset from Kaggle. This dataset contains information on various factors related to employee demographics, job roles, work experience, and satisfaction levels. The dataset includes features such as:
- Age
- Monthly Income
- Job Role
- Distance from Home
- Years at Company
- Job Satisfaction
- Work-Life Balance
- Attrition (target variable)

#### Tools and Technologies
- **ZenML**: A powerful MLOps framework that helps in orchestrating machine learning pipelines. It integrates seamlessly with other tools, including MLflow, and allows for the easy deployment and monitoring of models.
- **MLflow**: An open-source platform used for tracking experiments, managing models, and deploying models to production.
- **Streamlit**: A Python-based web application framework that allows for the rapid development of user interfaces for machine learning applications.
- **Scikit-learn**: A Python library used for training the machine learning model, specifically a Logistic Regression model for predicting employee attrition.

#### Solution Architecture
The solution was divided into several stages, each of which was implemented as a step in the ZenML pipeline.

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - The data was ingested from a CSV file containing employee records. A ZenML pipeline was set up to automate this process, ensuring that the latest data could be processed with minimal manual intervention.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - The raw dataset contained several unnecessary columns such as Employee ID and Employee Count, which were removed during the cleaning process. Additionally, categorical columns such as Gender, Department, and Job Role were converted into numerical values using one-hot encoding.
   - Missing data and outliers were handled to ensure that the dataset was ready for training.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Certain features, such as ‘Attrition’, which was originally recorded as “Yes” or “No,” were converted into binary values (1 or 0) to make them compatible with the model.
   - The dataset was split into training and testing sets in an 80:20 ratio to evaluate the performance of the model.

4. **Model Training**:
   - A **Logistic Regression** model was selected due to its simplicity and effectiveness in binary classification tasks.
   - The model was trained on the historical data using features like job satisfaction, monthly income, and years at the company to predict the probability of an employee leaving.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - The model was evaluated using metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**. These metrics were tracked using **MLflow** to compare the performance of different models.
   - Once a model met the performance criteria, it was promoted to production.

6. **Continuous Deployment Pipeline**:
   - A continuous deployment pipeline was set up using ZenML. This ensured that whenever a new model outperformed the existing model (based on a predefined threshold), it would automatically be deployed to the prediction server.
   - **MLflow** was used to manage model versions and deployment, ensuring that only the best model was in production at any given time.

7. **Streamlit Application**:
   - A **Streamlit** app was built to provide an intuitive interface for HR professionals. The app allowed users to input employee details (such as age, monthly income, years at the company, etc.) and receive real-time predictions on whether the employee was at risk of leaving.
   - The app communicated with the deployed model through an API, making real-time predictions using the most up-to-date model.

#### Conclusion
The Employee Attrition Prediction system developed using ZenML and Streamlit is a prime example of how MLOps can be leveraged to solve critical business problems. By automating the entire machine learning lifecycle, the system ensures that only the most accurate models are used for predictions, providing HR professionals with actionable insights that drive better decision-making. The successful deployment of this project highlights the potential of machine learning in enhancing employee retention and reducing operational costs.

The integration of ZenML, MLflow, and Streamlit not only streamlined the machine learning process but also made the solution accessible to non-technical users, demonstrating the power of MLOps in transforming business operations.
